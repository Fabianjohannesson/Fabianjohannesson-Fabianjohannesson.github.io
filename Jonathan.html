    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jonathan Grote and im 16 years old. I live in a small part of Gothenburg called Ögryte. I live in a house with my german dad, mom and 2 sisters. We also have a cat named Pepps, he is a maincoon and really damn big. Me and my family often travel to Germany to the small town called Meppen where my aunt lives.
            </p>
        <p>Before the gymnasium i went to a public school called Kärralundsskolan. It was a good school but pretty though. We were 3 classes with around 25 people in every class, everyone were friends with eachother and the schoolhalls were always filled with action and drama. When the 9th grade was over i started in gymnasium called GTG, it was a really good school with a lot of nice people but it was too far away from where i live so i switched to Amerikanska gymnasiet.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>My main interest is to be with friends and just hangout. I also spend a lot of time working out, i workout at the gym Sats kompassen where i often train with other friends. I also have a interest for cooking food and trying to test my cooking limits. When im not being with friends or training im either studying or playing computergames like GTA or LOL but i mostly talk on discord. I also love watching swedish cooking/baking programs or movies/series on Netflix, my favorite series right now is Top boy. </p>
