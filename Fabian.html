    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I’m 16 years old from Gothenburg, Sweden currently studying at Amerikanska Gymnasiet. I have previously studied at Fridaskolan at Hisingen, which was a good school where I studied for 4 years. What was so special about that school was that it prepared the students to be independent. For example, the teacher did not say if you had homework because it was your own responsibility to find it out. Another thing that marks the school is that we were about 72 people in each class. The 72 students were divided into three groups. After every break, these groups mixed with each other so the whole class would get a strong connection.
</p>
    <h2>Interests </h2>
        <p>During my spare time, I like to play football and exercise. At present, I’m playing for the football team Kärra KIF U16. Otherwise, I like running in the woods or going to the gym.</p>
        <p>My football team recently won our league, with 17 points. We scored over one hundred goals in just 20 games played. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have played football for about 10 years, and the previous football club I played for was Finlandia Pallo AIF, which was a fun team to be in because everyone in the team went to the same school as me. The reason why I stopped playing for them is that a lot of players left the team, which means that there were not enough players left, which meant we had to shut down.</p>
